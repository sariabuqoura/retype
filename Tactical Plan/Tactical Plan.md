# Tactical Plan 
Tactical Plan The tactical plan is a midterm plan developed to provide more details on accomplishing the goals set forth in the strategic plan, or can be crafted ad hoc based on unpredicted events. A tactical plan is typically useful for about a year and often prescribes and schedules the tasks necessary to accomplish organizational goals. Some examples of tactical plans are project plans, acquisition plans, hiring plans, budget plans, maintenance plans, support plans, and system development plans.
