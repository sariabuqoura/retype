# Strategic Plan
Strategic Plan A strategic plan is a long-term plan that is fairly stable. It defines the
organization’s security purpose. It defines the security function and aligns it to the goals,
mission, and objectives of the organization. It’s useful for about five years, if it is maintained
and updated annually. The strategic plan also serves as the planning horizon.
Long-term goals and visions for the future are discussed in a strategic plan. A strategic
plan should include a risk assessment.
