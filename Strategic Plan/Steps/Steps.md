# Steps

---

## 1. Security Purpose (Why Security Exists)

**Goal:** Explain why security matters to the business (not technology).

**How to do it**
- Read the company mission, vision, and business goals  
- Translate them into security language  

**Example**
> The purpose of the security program is to protect customer trust, ensure business continuity, meet regulatory obligations, and enable safe business growth.

**Output**
- 2–3 sentences  
- Non-technical  
- Business-focused  

---

## 2. Business Context (What You Are Protecting)

**Goal:** Align security with how the company actually operates.

**Document**
- Business model (SaaS, retail, fintech, services, etc.)
- Critical assets:
  - Customer data
  - Revenue-generating systems
  - Intellectual property
- Regulatory drivers (if any): ISO, PCI, GDPR, local laws

**Output**
- Short business overview  
- List of “crown jewels”  

---

## 3. Security Scope & Functions

**Goal:** Clarify what security is responsible for.

**Typical Security Functions (Small Company)**
- Governance & policy  
- Risk management  
- Asset management  
- Identity & access management  
- Infrastructure & application security  
- Incident response  
- Third-party risk  
- Awareness & training  

**Output**
- One-page scope definition  
- What security **owns** vs **supports**  

---

## 4. High-Level Risk Assessment

**Note:** Mandatory for a strategic plan.

**How (Lightweight)**
- Identify top risks (10–15 max)
- Rate each risk:
  - Likelihood: Low / Medium / High
  - Impact: Low / Medium / High
- Map risks to business impact

**Example Risks**
- Data breach of customer PII  
- Cloud misconfiguration  
- Ransomware  
- Insider misuse  
- Third-party compromise  
- Regulatory non-compliance  

**Output**
- Simple risk register (table)
- Highlight top 5–7 strategic risks  

---

## 5. Security Vision (5-Year Target State)

**Goal:** Define where security should be in five years.

**Example Vision**
> By year five, security will be risk-driven, embedded in business processes, aligned with industry standards, and capable of supporting growth without slowing the business.

**Focus On**
- Maturity, not tools  
- Predictable and measurable security  

---

## 6. Strategic Security Objectives (3–6 Only)

**Definition:** Long-term goals, not projects.

**Examples**
- Establish a formal risk-based security governance model  
- Reduce high-risk findings year-over-year  
- Achieve compliance with ISO 27001 / NIST CSF  
- Integrate security into product development  
- Improve incident detection and response capability  

**Rule**
- Each objective must support a business goal  

---

## 7. Strategic Initiatives (How Objectives Are Achieved)

**Guideline**
- Each objective has 2–4 initiatives  

**Example**
**Objective:** Improve risk management  
**Initiatives**
- Implement annual enterprise risk assessment  
- Create a security exception and risk acceptance process  
- Report top risks to management quarterly  

**Output**
- Initiatives mapped to objectives  
- No tools mentioned  

---

## 8. Multi-Year Roadmap (3–5 Years)

**Goal:** Turn strategy into phased execution.

**Example Roadmap**
- **Year 1:** Foundations (policies, risk assessment, asset inventory)  
- **Year 2:** Control improvement (IAM, logging, backups)  
- **Year 3:** Monitoring & response maturity  
- **Year 4:** Automation & optimization  
- **Year 5:** Continuous improvement  

**Output**
- High-level timeline (not a project plan)  

---

## 9. Metrics & Success Criteria

**Principle:** Measure outcomes, not activity.

**Examples**
- % of critical assets with defined owners  
- Number of high risks accepted vs mitigated  
- Incident detection time (MTTD)  
- Compliance audit results  
- Security awareness completion rate  

---

## 10. Governance & Review Model

**Define**
- Strategy owner  
- Review authority  
- Review frequency  

**Example**
- Strategy reviewed annually  
- Risk assessment updated yearly  
- Adjusted when business changes  

---

## 11. Final Strategic Plan Structure

Your final **Security Strategic Plan** should include:

1. Executive Summary  
2. Security Purpose & Vision  
3. Business Context  
4. Security Scope & Functions  
5. Risk Assessment Summary  
6. Strategic Objectives  
7. Strategic Initiatives  
8. Multi-Year Roadmap  
9. Metrics & KPIs  
10. Governance & Review

## Key Rule for Small Companies

- **Strategy** = direction  
- **Policies** = rules  
- **Roadmaps** = execution
