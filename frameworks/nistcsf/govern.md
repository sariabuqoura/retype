  - `Ex1:  Share the organization’s mission (e.g., through vision and mission statements, marketing, and service strategies) to provide a basis for identifying risks that may impede that mission`

- GV.OC-02: Internal and external stakeholders are understood, and their needs and expectations regarding cybersecurity risk management are understood and considered
  - `Ex1:  Identify relevant internal stakeholders and their cybersecurity-related expectations (e.g., performance and risk expectations of officers, directors, and advisors; cultural expectations of employees)`
  - `Ex2:  Identify relevant external stakeholders and their cybersecurity-related expectations (e.g., privacy expectations of customers, business expectations of partnerships, compliance expectations of regulators, ethics expectations of society)`

- GV.OC-03: Legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements regarding cybersecurity — including privacy and civil liberties obligations — are understood and managed`
  - `Ex1:  Determine a process to track and manage legal and regulatory requirements regarding protection of individuals’ information (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, California Consumer Privacy Act, General Data Protection Regulation) `
  - `Ex2:  Determine a process to track and manage contractual requirements for cybersecurity management of supplier, customer, and partner information`
  - `Ex3:  Align the organization’s cybersecurity strategy with legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements`

  - `Ex3:  Establish and communicate resilience objectives (e.g., recovery time objectives) for delivering critical capabilities and services in various operating states (e.g., under attack, during recovery, normal operation)`

- GV.OC-05: Outcomes, capabilities, and services that the organization depends on are understood and communicated
  - `Ex1:  Create an inventory of the organization’s dependencies on external resources (e.g., facilities, cloud-based hosting providers) and their relationships to organizational assets and business functions`
  - `Ex2:  Identify and document external dependencies that are potential points of failure for the organization’s critical capabilities and services, and share that information with appropriate personnel`
