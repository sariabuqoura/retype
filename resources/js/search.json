Actions to reduce cybersecurity risk might benefit an organization in other ways, like increasing revenue.(e.g., first offering excess facility space to a commercial hosting provider for hosting their own and other organizations’ data centers, then moving a major financial system from the organization’s in-house data center to the hosting provider to reduce cybersecurity risks).","Outcomes are clear, measurable security results that an organization aims to achieve.","Outcomes describe the desired security state.","Controls, Tools, and Processes exist only to achieve these outcomes.","Outcomes are mapped directly to a list of potential security controls for immediate consideration to mitigate cybersecurity risks.","Example: “Unauthorized users are prevented from accessing systems”.
