The team or department responsible for security within an organization should be autonomous.","The information security (InfoSec) team should be led by a designated chief information security officer (CISO) who reports directly to senior management, such as","The chief information officer (CIO).","The chief executive officer (CEO).","or the board of directors.","Placing the autonomy of the CISO and the CISO's team outside the typical hierarchical structure in an organization can improve security management across the entire organization. It also helps avoid cross-department and internal political issues.","The term chief security officer (CSO) is sometimes used as an alternative to CISO, but in many organizations the CSO position is a subposition under the CISO that focuses on physical security. Another potential term for the CISO is information security officer (ISO), but this also can be used as a subposition under the CISO."]},{"l":"Checklist","p":["Can you confirm that executive sponsorship has been secured.","Schedule a brief recurring meeting (no more than 15 minutes) to update management."]}]]
