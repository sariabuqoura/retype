It also helps avoid cross-department and internal political issues.","The term chief security officer (CSO) is sometimes used as an alternative to CISO, but in many organizations the CSO position is a subposition under the CISO that focuses on physical security. Another potential term for the CISO is information security officer (ISO), but this also can be used as a subposition under the CISO."]},{"l":"Checklist","p":["Can you confirm that executive sponsorship has been secured.","Schedule a brief recurring meeting (no more than 15 minutes) to update management."]}],[{"i":"#","p":["Last Update on Jan, 2026."]},{"l":"NIST Cybersecurity (CSF)"},{"l":"Overview","p":["The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks.","It offers a taxonomy of high level cybersecurity outcomes that can be used by any organization regardless of its size, sector, or maturity to better understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate its cybersecurity efforts.","Ideally, the CSF will be used to address cybersecurity risks alongside other risks of the enterprise, including those that are financial, privacy, supply chain, reputational, technological, or physical in nature.","The CSF describes desired outcomes that are intended to be understood by a broad audience,including executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise.","While many cybersecurity risk management activities focus on preventing negative events from occurring, they may also support taking advantage of positive opportunities. Actions to reduce cybersecurity risk might benefit an organization in other ways, like increasing revenue.(e.g., first offering excess facility space to a commercial hosting provider for hosting their own and other organizations’ data centers, then moving a major financial system from the organization’s in-house data center to the hosting provider to reduce cybersecurity risks).","Outcomes are clear, measurable security results that an organization aims to achieve.","Outcomes describe the desired security state.","Controls, Tools, and Processes exist only to achieve these outcomes.","Outcomes are mapped directly to a list of potential security controls for immediate consideration to mitigate cybersecurity risks.","Example: “Unauthorized users are prevented from accessing systems”.
